Docker Basics:

Why do we need Docker?  

--> To solve problem "It is not working on my system"



How Docker solve this problem?

--> There are basically 3 layers i.e., application layer, OS kernel and hardware. Docker create virtualization layer in the application layer.

--> Suppose we are using Node and MongoDB then docker creates a single unit of it and shift it to other teammates (shifts whole environment of application layer). That is its like creating package.



Docker works on application layer. 
Virtual machine works on application layer along with OS kernel.



In terminal:

--> docker run hello-world
--> docker pull hello-world
    (tag means version)
    (we create image of application and push it on docker hub)
    (image - classes, container - objects)
--> docker run hello-world
    (o/p: Hello from Docker!)
--> docker pull ubuntu
--> docker run -it ubuntu
    --> ls
    --> mkdir juet
    --> ls
    --> cd juet
    --> touch emp
    --> ls
    --> exit (exit from Linux)



Docker Network:

--> Creates isolated network so that 2 containers can communicate without hassle (one is mongo and another is mongo-express (admin interface)).

--> docker network create mongo-network
--> docker network ls
--> docker run -d -p 27017(local host):27017(default mongo) --name mongo--network mongo-network -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=admin mongo
--> docker ps (which containers are running in this moment)
--> docker ps -a (images which are available)
--> docker network inspect mongo-network
--> docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name mongo-express MONGODB_ADMINUSER=admin -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_URL="mongodb://admin:admin@mongo:27017" mongo-express
